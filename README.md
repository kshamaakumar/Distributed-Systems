# Distributed-Systems
Labs done as a part of Distributed System coursework
Lab 1 : Write a simple client that connects to a Group Coordinator Daemon (GCD) which will respond with a list of potential group members
Lab 2 : This lab we expand on Lab1 and join a group. This group will be fully interconnected (like a round table) and we endeavor to choose a leader using the bully algorithm. Choosing a leader is a form of consensus.
Lab3 : In this lab we build a process that listens to currency exchange rates from a price feed and prints out a message whenever there is an arbitrage opportunity available.
Lab 4 : Implementing using Python 3 the Chord system as described in the original paper "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications" by Stoica, Morris, Karger,  Kaashoek, and Balakrishna.
Lab 5 : In this lab we are getting an old block from the BitCoin block chain and demonstrate how any changes would be caught by the BitCoin network.
